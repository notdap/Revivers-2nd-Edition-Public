# Revivers: 2nd Edition (Public Version)

The Revivers: 2nd Edition plugin offers a copy of Hypixel's TNT Tag experience. It requires Vault and NametagEdit as dependencies, and is not to be confused with Ignite (separate project).
This is the source that was used to compile the public plugin of Revivers, and it contains features that did not make it into the public compiled plugin, such as /spectate. This repository is not owned by TTC and anyone can fork off of it and use the source for whatever they wish

## How to build
Change your directory to the **Revivers: 2nd Edition** directory and run ``mvn clean package``. This will generate a JAR file in the ``/target`` directory that you can put in your server. 

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are only allowed if they don't alter the TNT Tag functionality or if they help it remain more similar to Hypixel's TNT Tag.
